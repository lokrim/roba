"""Track B agent wiring (02 §B1–§B5).

``register`` is the single entry point the core app shell calls at startup
(``core/api.py`` bootstrap) once per process. It constructs the three Track B
agents plus the Procurement service and the approval handlers, subscribes the
agents to their groups, registers them with the orchestrator (so in-group
signals are routed to ``on_signal``), wires the per-line depletion callback
(§10), and registers each agent's §17 interval triggers.

When ``DEMO_MODE=track_b`` it also constructs and registers the
:class:`~track_b.mocks.mock_forecaster.MockForecaster`, the placeholder that
drives the whole track (§B5). In ``combined`` the mock is omitted — real Track A
``DEMAND_FORECAST`` / ``BATCH_DECISION`` signals arrive instead, with no other
code change (§B8).
