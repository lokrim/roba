"""BaseAgent — the abstract base every track agent subclasses.

An agent talks to the rest of the system *only* through the signal bus (§2):
it ``subscribe``s to groups (the orchestrator routes in-group signals to its
``on_signal``), ``emit``s new signals (defaulting ``source`` to its name), and
``log_event``s narrative rows into ``event_log`` stamped with the current
``sim_time`` (read from the bus, which the clock advances each tick).
