"""Orchestrator — the per-tick engine and trigger registry (§17).

Every tick (§6.1) the orchestrator:
  1. advances ``sim_time`` by ``Δsim = 60 × speed × 0.25`` (handling the
     closed-hours auto-jump 23:00 → next-day 08:00 when ``skip_closed_hours``),
  2. writes the new ``sim_time`` (and derived day fields) back to ``sim_state``,
  3. fires due **interval** triggers,
  4. fires due **deadline** triggers,
  5. sweeps expired signals via ``bus.sweep(now)``,
  6. fires ``scenario_events`` whose ``at_sim_time ≤ now`` and ``fired = 0``,
  7. publishes ``now`` onto the bus (``bus.sim_time``), and
  8. returns the list of WS events to broadcast (at minimum ``sim_tick``).

It also holds the in-process registry of the five §17 trigger kinds
(``interval | deadline | signal_driven | threshold | manual``) and routes
signals to subscribed agents (§14.4). The async ``run_loop`` drives ``tick``
on the real-time cadence while the clock is ``RUNNING``.
