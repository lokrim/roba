"""Vertex AI Live API bridge for the Roba voice interface.

Architecture:
  Browser ⟷ our WS /ws/voice/live?role=<role>&mode=<mode>
           ⟷ Vertex AI Live session (google-genai SDK, vertexai=True)

The browser sends binary PCM16 @16kHz audio frames and optional JSON control
frames.  We relay audio to the Live session and forward audio output + transcript
events back.  Tool calls from the model (process_note, confirm_plan, etc.) are
executed server-side and their results returned to the session.

Falls back gracefully: when ``GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`` is unresolvable (no env var
and no ``roba.json``) or the genai import fails, the WS immediately sends
``{"type":"unavailable"}`` so the client can degrade to text + browser speech
synthesis.

Authentication: service-account JSON at ``roba.json`` (repo root) or the path in
``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS``, falling back to Application Default Credentials.
Handled by ``core.vertex.build_genai_client()``.

Audio spec (mandated by the Live API):
  • Browser → server: 16 kHz, mono, 16-bit LE PCM
  • Server → browser: 24 kHz, mono, 16-bit LE PCM

SDK notes (google-genai v2.8+):
  • session.send() is deprecated — use send_realtime_input / send_client_content
    / send_tool_response.
  • session.receive() yields chunks until turn_complete, then raises StopAsyncIteration.
    For a multi-turn session wrap it in ``while True:``.
  • chunk.data  → concatenated inline audio bytes (shortcut property)
  • chunk.text  → concatenated text parts (shortcut property)
  • chunk.server_content.input_transcription.text  → what the user said
  • chunk.server_content.output_transcription.text → what Roba said
